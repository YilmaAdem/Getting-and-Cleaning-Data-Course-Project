     The script ( run_analysis.R)  does the following and the result is creating a tidyData.txt
	·	Download the dataset 
	·	Loads and reads the activity and feature info
	·	Loads and reads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
	·	Loads and read the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
	·	Merges the two datasets
	.       Create final datasets
	·	Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average.
